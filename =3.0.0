==> Caveats
By default, binaries installed by gem will be placed into:
  /opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/3.3.0/bin

You may want to add this to your PATH.

ruby is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have ruby first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/jiyuhu2/.bash_profile

For compilers to find ruby you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/include"
