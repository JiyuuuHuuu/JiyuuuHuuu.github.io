I started my Ph.D. at UIUC working with [Ram](https://ramalagappan.github.io/) and [Aishwarya](https://aishwaryaganesan.github.io/) in 2023. My area of interest is distributed and storage systems. \
\
Before joining UIUC as a Ph.D., I finished my undergraduate also at UIUC working with Prof. [Indranil Gupta](https://indy.cs.illinois.edu/), and got a master's degree from CMU with Prof. [Rashmi Vinayak](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rvinayak/).
