### Bio
My name is written as 胡济宇 in Chinese. I was born in Anhui, China. I moved to Ibaraki, Japan with my family when I was 3 and lived there for 6 years. To this day, I can still understand Japanese pretty well. I read novels and watch videos in Japanese, but my speaking ability has degraded so much. I hope to practice Japanese with other folks. I moved to Shanghai, China when I was 10 and stayed there until I graduated high school.

### Soccer
I both watch and play soccer. My team: Bayern Munich, Mia san Mia!!! Personally, I play winger (either side is fine) and full back (preferably right). I play for [UIUCFA](https://www.instagram.com/cfa_uiuc/). We compete in intramurals and regional chinese tournaments. Hit me up anytime at Siebel if you wanna play pickups or watch UCL ;)

### Snowboard
I have been snowboarding for three seasons (since '21). Fav mountains: [Brighton](https://brightonresort.com/), [Snowbird](https://www.snowbird.com/). Big fan of the Cottonwoods! I have been mostly enjoying freerides (or more precisely just cruising), but will be an eager learner if someone can teach me park tricks (dreaming of landing my first 3s since first season lol). I have also explored local mountains (within 6h drive), among which [Granite Peak](https://www.skigranitepeak.com/) might be the best. Looking forward to explore more mountains all over the world!

### Reading
I love reading novels, and try to do as much as I can. However, I have to admit that Ph.D. is not particularly friendly to reading anything other than academic papers. I am trying to squeeze more time for reading non CS-related literatures. I would love to chat about books with peers. Some of my fav books/novels:
* [Shayou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Setting_Sun)
* [Kinkaku-Ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Temple_of_the_Golden_Pavilion)
* [Yukiguni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Country)
* [The Unbearable Lightness of Being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unbearable_Lightness_of_Being)

Next books I aim to read:
* [One Hundred Years of Solitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude)
* [Hojo no Umi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_of_Fertility)
